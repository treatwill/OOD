## Core Requirements:

- Select any 4 of the above packages to complete.  A minimum of 4 packages is necessary to meet the core requirements for this assignment.  
- In addition to code quality, keep in mind your project structure as you build the mini applications.

## Optional Requirements

- Complete up to all 8 of the java packages
- Build the applications using a TDD approach, leveraging the test folder in `src`.  Classes have been placed in the test folder corresponding to the main class of each mini-app.  Add any additional classes to the `test` folder as necessary as you build out your mini-apps
